Counter	from collections import Counter		
			
	Init		
		c=Counter()	
		c=Counter("aword")	
		c=Counter("My name is hanmeimei, and I love My country".split())	
	del	use del to remove it entirely	
		del c["a"]	
			
	elements()	ruturn an iterator over elements repeating each as many times as its count, elements are returned in arbitrary order.	
		list(c.elements())	
			
	most_common([n])	return a list of the n most common elements and their counts from the most common to the least.	
		Counter("abstract").most_common(3)	
			
	subtract	elements are subtract from an iterable or from another mapping	
		c=Counter("american")	
		d=Counter("chinese")	
		c.subtract(d)	
		c	
	fromkeys()		
	update()		
			
	others		
		c.values()	
		c.keys()	
		c.items()	
		c.clear()	
		c+=Counter()	remove zero and negative counts

deque	from collections import deque		
	append()		
	appendleft()		
	extend()		
	extendleft()		
	clear()		
	count(x)	count the number of deque elements equal to x	
	pop()		
	popleft()		
	remove(value)	remove the first occurrenct of value, if not found, raise a valueerror	
	reverse()		
	rotate(n=1)	rotate the last n value to the right, if n is negative, the rotate to the left	
			
defaultdict	from collections import defaultdict		
	dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values		
	the difference between dict and defaultdict		
	dict,在检索时,如果不存在key值,会报error, defaultdict改进了这一特性		
			
namedtuple			
	_mark()	Class method that makes a new instance from an existing sequence or iterable.	
	_asdict()	Return a new OrderedDict which maps field names to their corresponding values	
	_replace()	Return a new instance of the named tuple replacing specified fields with new values:	
	_fields()	Tuple of strings listing the field names. Useful for introspection and for creating new named tuple types from existing named tuples.	
			
		Point=namedtuple("Point", ["x", "y"])	
		p1 = Point(1, 2)	
			
		Student = namedtuple('Student', ['name', 'age', 'gender'])	
		stus = [("小明", 21, "男性"), ("小宏", 21, "女性")] 	
			
OrderedDict			
	Ordered dictionaries are just like regular dictionaries but they remember the order that items were inserted.
